<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

 <b>The project began with automating the extraction of Adidas sales data from the website using Python. After obtaining the raw data, Excel was used for cleaning and transforming the dataset. This involved using Power Query to correct inconsistencies, handle missing data, and create necessary features like monthly sales and product categories. Pivot Tables in Excel were used for summarizing sales by region, selling methods, product type, and Retailer segment. After the data was cleaned and structured, I further manipulated it in Python (using Pandas and NumPy) to perform more detailed analysis. The final step involved creating insightful visualizations to communicate key trends, which could inform Adidas' business strategies..</b>
